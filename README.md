## Project setup

To set up the project in your local environment, follow the steps below:

Make sure you have the following installed:

- `nvm` to manage node versions
- `just` as task runner (similar to Makefile but easier to use)
- `lefthook` as git hooks manager

Create the files with the environment variables:

```sh
touch .env.development.local # Development environment
touch .env.production.local # Production environment
touch .env.test.local # Test environment
```

Run these commands in the project root directory:

```sh
just setup # Set up the project
just dev # Start the development server
```
